# OTVerb
OTVerb is a dirty Reverb VST plugin.
I made with cycling Max(gen~) + JUCE(C++).

I aim to make sound for some genre such as shoegaze, dreampop, idm, ambient.

The OTVerb is implemented from Max for live devices.

If you get M4L Devices. you can get here.

# Development Statas
VST build is not implemented GUIs.
I developed only audio processing.
